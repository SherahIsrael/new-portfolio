            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>My coding journey started in 2020 when I did an Access to HE Engineering 
                Diploma. I learned about C# and databases. My journey continued when I 
                went to Surrey University to study Electrical and Electronic Engineering.
                During my time there I studied Python.  
            </p>
            <p>Now I am an aspiring Software Developer. Having recently completed a 
                12 week software development bootcamp, I have been gaining knowledge and 
                experience in multiple coding languages.</p>
